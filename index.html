            <h2>A few facts about the world we live in</h2>

            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. 
According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over <mark> 4.5 billion</mark> years ago. 
Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. 
Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis 
about <strong>366.26 times.</strong>  Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth.
The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis and gradually 
slows its rotation.Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four terrestrial planets.
Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. 
About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and 
islands that together contain many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. The majority of 
Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. 
Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field and a 
convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.
